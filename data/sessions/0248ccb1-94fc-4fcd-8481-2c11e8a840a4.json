Let's review the situation:\n\n- I successfully wrote the file `a.txt` in `data/outputs/` based on the previous tool result, which confirmed the operation was okay.\n- However, I was unable to proceed with writing `b.txt` due to the tool restrictions (e.g., budget limits or rules preventing additional writes in this session).\n\nAs a result, the task is only partially complete:\n- **a.txt** has been created with the content: \"This is the content for a.txt.\"\n- **b.txt** could not be written.\n\nIf you need to verify the files or perform other actions (like listing the directory), let me know, and I'll assist within the allowed tools. Otherwise, you may need to handle further file creation manually or in a future session."
